Code Refactor for Horiseon

Basic tags were switched out for descriptive tags to define different part of the webpage to improve 
overall navigation of all users as well as giving a more attractive appearance to the coding for easy readability.

I took on this challenge to organize the code because organization improves productivity and reduces rework.

There is a navigation bar that is in-line with the header. If a user would like to read a certain feature listed on the navigation bar, they can select that feature leading them that particular section of the page. If a speech output system is used on this page, it would be able to describe the images.

This page was built in Visual Studio Code using the an indentation style.
